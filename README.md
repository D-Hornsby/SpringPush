# SpringPush

Project Title

E-Commerce for everyone

Motivation
 
 I wanted to build an e connerce web application that the artist around me, including myself,  could use. I wanted to have the bones of the app set up so that all that would need to be done is to add the information about the artist and there products. 
  

Build status
  
  This is the start of what I had in mind. It has a log in and a register page. After you log in you can see the shopping cart. At this time it has a list of items and prices with the pic. 
  I am going to add a page before that to display items and maybe reconsider how I have the log in and regeristeration page in the begining. At this time when you log in all items hard coaded are in the cart. You can remove items, clear the cart, add more of that item and adjust the cart how you want it with a running total and a counter of items reflecting your adjustments. 

Code style
  
  At this time I am learning how to better use React, redux, spring and sql so there is a lot of commiting to show paths and notes to refer to as I learn. 

The build
  
  HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, AJAX, MAVEN, REACT, REDUX, React-Router with RESTful routing  SQL, POSTGRES, POSTMAN
